  description: >-
    without a clue of what sort of content was right for me, and eventually
    found a love and passion for reviewing video games, so I'm trying to focus
    mostly on that from now on. 

    I've left the old content on the channel, so that it can be used to
    incriminate me later.

    Thanks for stopping by!"

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
